# Configuring backup and restore for hosted control planes and hosted clusters

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management backup and restore component currently does not provide policies that can be used to backup and restore your hosted clusters and hosted control planes. Refer to [Overview of Hosted Cluster backup and restore process](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html/hosted_control_planes/high-availability-for-hosted-control-planes# hcp-backup-restore-aws-overview_hcp-disaster-recovery-aws) and [OpenShift Hosted Control Plane Disaster Recovery documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/hosted_control_planes/high-availability-for-hosted-control-planes#hcp-disaster-recovery-oadp) on how to backup and restore hosted clusters.

The OpenShift Hosted Control Plane Disaster Recovery documentation describes how to install and configure the OpenShift API for Data Protection. If you are using the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management backup and restore component, the OpenShift API for Data Protection installation procedure overlaps between these two documents and therefore you should follow the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management backup and restore document. It install the OADP in `open-cluster-management-backup` namespace instead of the default `openshift-adp` namespace. Therefore the OADP resources such as `DataProtectionApplication`, `BackupSchedule`, `Backup` and `Restore` for your hosted clusters need to be created in `open-cluster-management-backup` namespace.

When restroing the ACM hub cluster, it is recommended to restore the hosted clusters by following [OpenShift Hosted Control Plane Disaster Recovery documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/hosted_control_planes/high-availability-for-hosted-control-planes#hcp-disaster-recovery-oadp) before restoring the ACM hub.
