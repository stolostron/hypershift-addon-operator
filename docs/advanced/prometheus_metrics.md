# Metrics data generated by the hypershift addon agent from a hosting cluster

When you enable the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster addon, the metric service monitoring is configured by default so that OCP monitoring can scrape metrics data from the hypershift addon agent. This document describes the instrumented metrics and how to disable the metric service monitoring.

## Metrics

| **Name** | **Description** | 
| --- | --- |
| *mce_hs_addon_failed_to_start_bool* | When the hypershift-addon agent controller fails to start, its value becomes 1 (true), otherwise it remains 0 (false). |
| *mce_hs_addon_install_in_progress_bool* | When installation or upgrade of the hypershift operator is in progress, its value becomes 1 (true). Otherwise it remains 0 (false). |
| *mce_hs_addon_install_failure_gauge* | When the hypershift operator installation or upgrade fails, its value increases. The value resets to zero upon when the installation or upgrade completes successfully. |
| *mce_hs_addon_placement_score_failure_count* | When the hypershift operator fails to create or update the `hosted-clusters-score` AddOnPlacementScore in the hosting cluster's namespace on the hub cluster, its value increases by one for each failure. See [here](https://github.com/stolostron/hypershift-addon-operator/blob/main/docs/scheduling_hosted_cluster.md) for more detail.|
| *mce_hs_addon_cluster_claims_failure_count* | When the hypershift operator fails to create or update a ClusterClaim on the hosting cluster, its value increases by one.   **Label values:** *full-hc* for full.hostedclustercount.hypershift.openshift.io ClusterClaim, *threshold-hs* for above.threshold.hostedclustercount.hypershift.openshift.io ClusterClaim, *zero-hc* for zero.hostedclustercount.hypershift.openshift.io ClusterClaim. See [here](https://github.com/stolostron/hypershift-addon-operator/blob/main/docs/scheduling_hosted_cluster.md) for more detail.|
| *mce_hs_addon_kubeconfig_secret_copy_failure_count* | Its value increases everytime the addon agent fails to copy a hosted cluster's kubeconfig into its klusterlet namespace. |
| *mce_hs_addon_hub_sync_failure_count* | Its value increases everytime the addon agent fails to read either a secret or configmap that are necessary for the hypershift operator installation from the hub cluster.   **Label values:** *secret*, *configmap* |
| *mce_hs_addon_total_hosted_control_planes_gauge* | This gauge indicates the total number of hosted control planes on the hosting cluster. |
| *mce_hs_addon_available_hosted_control_planes_gauge* | This gauge indicates the number of available hosted control planes on the hosting cluster. An available hosted control plane has a running kube API server. |
| *mce_hs_addon_available_hosted_clusters_gauge* | This gauge indicates the number of available hosted clusters on the hosting cluster. An available hosted cluster has a running kube API server as well as worker nodes. |
| *mce_hs_addon_max_hosted_clusters_gauge* | This gauge indicates the maximum number of hosted clusters to be allowed on the hosting cluster. See [here](https://github.com/stolostron/hypershift-addon-operator/blob/main/docs/advanced/scheduling_hosted_cluster.md#overriding-the-maximum-and-threshold-number-of-hosted-clusters) for more detail. |
| *mce_hs_addon_threshold_hosted_clusters_gauge* | This gauge indicates the threshold number of hosted clusters before reaching the maximum number on the hosting cluster. See [here](https://github.com/stolostron/hypershift-addon-operator/blob/main/docs/advanced/scheduling_hosted_cluster.md#overriding-the-maximum-and-threshold-number-of-hosted-clusters) for more detail. |
| *mce_hs_addon_hypershift_operator_degraded_bool* | When the hypershift-addon agent controller detects that the hypershift operator is not currently running, its value becomes 1 (true). Otherwise it remains 0 (false). |
| *mce_hs_addon_ext_dns_operator_degraded_bool* | When the hypershift-addon agent controller detects that the external DNS feature is enabled for the hypershift operator but the external DNS operator is not currently running, its value becomes 1 (true). Otherwise it remains 0 (false). If external DNS is not configured for the hypershift operator, this returns -1 to indicate that the the external DNS operator status is not applicable. |
| *mce_hs_addon_aws_s3_bucket_secret_configured_bool* | Is the hypershift operator installed with AWS S3 bucket secret?, 1 (true). 0 (false). |

## Disabling metric service monitoring configuration

1. Log into the hub cluster.

2. Edit `hypershift-addon-deploy-config` AddOnDeploymentConfig.

```bash
$ oc edit addondeploymentconfig hypershift-addon-deploy-config -n multicluster-engine
```

3. Add `disableMetrics=true` customized variable while leaving other customized variables intact and save. This will automatically disable the metric service monitoring configuration from existing hypershift-addon managed cluster addons and newly enabled hypershift-addon managed cluster addons.

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: AddOnDeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon-deploy-config
  namespace: multicluster-engine
spec:
  customizedVariables:
  - name: hcMaxNumber
    value: "80"
  - name: hcThresholdNumber
    value: "60"
  - name: disableMetrics
    value: "true"
```
